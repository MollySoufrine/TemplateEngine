# TemplateEngine

In this assignment I used JS and node to generate a team html page for a company through prompts in the terminal.

The objective of this assignment was to work with the terminal and become more familiar with node. In the terminal it would prompt the user if they would like to add a manager, engineer or intern to their team.
Based on their selection it would then generate questions about that team members id, email, name and then a specific role question.

Once the user was done generating their team there was an option for them to select, "i do not want to add another team member"

If they selected this then the information would be sent to team.html and generate the page with cards and the info of each team member that was input.
